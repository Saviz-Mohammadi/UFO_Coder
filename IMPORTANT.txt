Local storage works on a per domain basis (not per page) so any HTML pages will share the same LocalStorage database as long as they are on the same domain.

If you are currently developing your web application by opening websites through the filesystem ie: file://C:/Users/UserA/Documents/WWW/index.html the browser cannot detect that 2 different pages are on the same domain so it will create a new LocalStorage database for each instance.

You can get around this by hosting your web application through a Local or Remote webserver that your accessing the website via http://localhost:8080/index.html or https://example.com/index.html

This is why when you sometimes create a new html file or page, it will not obey the rest of the theme. This is not something to be worried about.
