                <h2>Toolchains</h2>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">OVERVIEW</span><br>
                    A toolchain is a collection of interconnected tools that work together to perform essential tasks in software development. These tasks typically include compiling, assembling, linking, debugging, resource management, documentation, code analysis, and overall managing the build process. These tools work in harmony to automate and streamline key stages of the software development lifecycle.
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    As a programmer, you’ve likely encountered various toolchains such as MSVC, GCC, and others, either through the terminal or integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio or Xcode. While these tools are essential, you may also remember the frustrations and challenges they sometimes bring. This tutorial focuses on teaching you CMake, so we won’t dive deeply into the specifics of these toolchains or their environments—there are already plenty of resources for that.
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                
                <p>
                    Platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux each have distinct toolchains optimized for their specific environments. These toolchains are designed to integrate seamlessly with the platform's architecture, ensuring efficient development and smooth tool interoperability. Before we can use CMake, it’s important to ensure that you have a functional toolchain installed and ready to go. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with these toolchains and install one of them. CMake relies on a toolchain to perform its tasks, so having one set up is a critical first step.

                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">DESCRIPTION</span><br>
                    The MSVC toolchain stands for <span class="highlight">"Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler"</span>, which contains a suite of tools including a compiler, linker, build system, resource manager, and more. These tools are primarily designed for and available exclusively on the Windows operating system. If you are using a Linux or MacOS machine, utilizing this toolchain can be either impossible or very challenging. This restriction is also why terms like "MSVC", "Visual Studio IDE", and "Windows" are often associated with each other, as they are closely interlinked.
                </p>



                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>






                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (Windows):</span><br>
                    MSVC is currently exclusive to the Windows operating system. You have two installation options. You can either download the toolchain completely standalone by referring to the <a class="link" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools" target="_blank">standalone installation</a> link, or you can use the complete suite provided alongside the <a class="link" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools" target="_blank">Visual Studio IDE installer</a>. Whichever method you choose, make sure to select the category of <span class="highlight">"C++ for Desktop development"</span> once the installer launches. This component will ensure that everything you need for developing C++ software is available to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">MAKING TOOLCHAIN VISIBLE TO CMAKE:</span><br>
                    After installing the toolchain on your machine, you need to ensure it is visible to CMake for generating your projects. The simplest method is to add the entire installation directory to your system's PATH. This allows CMake to automatically locate all necessary tools. This action is different from one platform and OS to another. You need to refer to the documentation section of your specific operating system to figure out how to add a certain tool to the system PATH.

                    <span class="highlight">DESCRIPTION</span><br>
                    The GCC tool chain stands for <span class="highlight">"GNU Compiler Collection"</span>. <a class="link" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GCC</a> is a suite of compilers and tools developed by the GNU Project. It is widely used for compiling C, C++, and other programming languages mostly on Unix-based platforms including Linux, and MacOS. Despite the fact that GCC can be used on both Linux and MacOS platforms, but it is mostly adopted by the Linux community. As a result it is only natural to assume that when we talk about GCC, then the target platform in question is most likely Linux.

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (Windows):</span><br>
                    For Windows platforms, you should refer to the <a class="link" href="#MinGW">MinGW</a> toolchain, as GCC itself is not directly available for Windows.
                </p>




                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>




                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (MacOS):</span><br>
                    For MacOS, the recommended method to install GCC is through the <a class="link" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew package manager</a>, where you can find the appropriate command on their website by searching for the keyword <span class="highlight">"gcc"</span>.

                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">DESCRIPTION</span><br>
                    The MinGW tool chain stands for <span class="highlight">"Minimalist GNU for Windows"</span>. MinGW is a port of GCC for Windows. It includes necessary utilities and libraries to facilitate native Windows development using GCC. As a result of this, when developers use the word "MinGW", then we can safely assume that the target platform is Windows. MinGW is highly similar to GCC in almost every aspect. Therefore, concepts applicable to GCC also apply seamlessly to MinGW. <a class="link" href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/" target="_blank">MinGW-w64</a> is the newest project of MinGW that aims to bring more functionality and support to Windows.

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (Windows):</span><br>
                    The latest iteration of the MinGW project, known as <span class="highlight">"MinGW-w64"</span>, incorporates the newest features from GCC. You can download the binaries directly from the <a class="link" href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/" target="_blank">official MinGW-w64 page</a>. From personal experience, the best approach is to download the binaries from the <a class="link" href="https://winlibs.com/" target="_blank">WinLibs.com</a> option offered by this page. On the WinLibs page you must scroll down to the <span class="highlight">"Release versions"</span> section to obtain the installers.

                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (MacOS):</span><br>
                    While MinGW is traditionally used for building Windows applications on Windows systems, it is possible to use this tool to create a cross-compilation environment. This enables us to compile Windows executables on non-Windows platforms such as MacOS. For MacOS, the recommended method to install MinGW is through the <a class="link" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew package manager</a>, where you can find the appropriate command on their website by searching for the keyword <span class="highlight">"mingw-w64"</span>.

                    <span class="highlight">INSTALLATION (MacOS):</span><br>
                    For MacOS, the recommended method to install Clang/LLVM is through the <a class="link" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew package manager</a>, where you can find the appropriate command on their website by searching for the keyword <span class="highlight">"llvm"</span>. Note that some installations of GCC or MinGW may include Clang/LLVM compilers and linkers, so you might already have them installed.

                    <span class="highlight">MAKING TOOLCHAIN VISIBLE TO CMAKE:</span><br>
                    After installing the toolchain on your machine, you need to ensure it is visible to CMake for generating your projects. The simplest method is to add the entire installation directory to your system's PATH. This allows CMake to automatically locate all necessary tools. This action is different from one platform and OS to another. You need to refer to the documentation section of your specific operating system to figure out how to add a certain tool to the system PATH.
