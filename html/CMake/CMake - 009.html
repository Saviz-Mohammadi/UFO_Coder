In CMake, both `include()` and `add_subdirectory()` are used to process other CMake files, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors:

### 1. **`include()`**
   - **Purpose**: The `include()` command is used to incorporate and execute another CMake file within the current CMake context. This is typically done for utility or configuration files that provide functions, macros, or settings that you want to use in multiple places.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It includes the specified CMake file and processes it immediately in the current directory's CMake scope.
     - The included file does **not** have its own CMake scope; it shares the scope of the file that called `include()`.
     - Typically used for reusable CMake scripts or modules that define functions, macros, or configurations.

   Example:
   ```cmake
   include(my_custom_macros.cmake)
   ```

   This brings all the definitions in `my_custom_macros.cmake` into the current scope.

### 2. **`add_subdirectory()`**
   - **Purpose**: The `add_subdirectory()` command adds a subdirectory (with its own `CMakeLists.txt`) to the build. This is used to build other parts of your project that may reside in subdirectories.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It tells CMake to descend into the specified subdirectory, process its `CMakeLists.txt`, and add the targets defined there to the current project.
     - The subdirectory gets its **own CMake scope**, meaning variables or settings defined inside the subdirectory are isolated from the parent unless explicitly passed or exported.
     - Used when you are dealing with different modules, libraries, or components that have their own CMakeLists files and need to be compiled independently.

   Example:
   ```cmake
   add_subdirectory(my_library)
   ```

   This processes the `CMakeLists.txt` in the `my_library` directory as a separate part of the build system.

### Key Differences:
- **Scope**: `include()` processes the included file in the current directory's CMake scope, while `add_subdirectory()` processes the file in the context of a subdirectory with its own scope.
- **Usage**: `include()` is used for including utility or configuration files (e.g., macros, functions), while `add_subdirectory()` is used to include entire projects or subprojects, often containing their own targets like libraries or executables.





for example:





CMake can include one script file inside another using the include() function (just like C/C++).
Here’s a simple example using the source-code from the Greetings library code in Section 6.1:
The root CMakeLists.txt
1 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24)
2 project(hello_world)
3
4 # Dependencies
5 include(libs/Greetings/Library.cmake)
6
7 # Our Project
8 list(APPEND SOURCE_FILES
9
 Main.cpp)
10
11 add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCE_FILES})
12 target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${INCLUDE_DIRS})
Chapter 13. Structuring Large Projects | 139
libs/Greetings/Library.cmake
1 list(APPEND SOURCE_FILES
2
 libs/Greetings/src/Hello.cpp)
3
4 list(APPEND INCLUDE_DIRS
5
 libs/Greetings/include)
The code above is relatively simple. Most of the work is done by the root CMakeLists.txt file. It uses the
include() function to "include" the Greetings module’s Library.cmake file into the script. This sub-script
simply adds the Greetings library’s source files and include directory to the relevant lists for the main
CMakeLists.txt file to use.






So, there is not really a difference other than philisophy I guess... Programmmers just natuarlly assume when seeing inculde() that ther intention is to add functionality, whearase add_subdirectory is a part of your porject.









also there is actually one huge difference:


Why include() instead of add_subdirectory() ?
Include() reads in a script file as if it were part of the original CMakeLists.txt file. By
contrast, add_subdirectory() executes the sub-directory’s script as an independent
script. The sub-script’s variables have a local scope, which makes them invisible to the
parent script. Therefore, passing data back to the main script requires special handling.
For example, adding files to the SOURCE_FILES variable would have to be done using the
set() function’s PARENT_SCOPE parameter. Include() is easier when you want to treat
the files as one big script (or want to share common code between multiple scripts).
Add_subdirectory() is intended for adding sub-projects.

A better alternative that can be much simpler and does not require manual intervention is this script which will automatically copy the directory entirely:


add_custom_target(CopyResources ALL
        COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/resources
        ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/resources

add_dependencies(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} CopyResources)

                    <span class="highlight">OVERVIEW</span><br>
                    No matter whether you're working with executable targets, library targets, unit tests, or any other components, in CMake the structure of your project plays a critical role. Organizing files and folders effectively within the file system impacts nearly every aspect of the build system. Since these files form the foundation of everything, it's essential to discuss project structure before diving into other topics. Let’s take a moment to focus on this important aspect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">OVERVIEW</span><br>
                    Up unitl now, we have seen how to command CMake to perform various things and we got a taste for it. but, the truth is that we will be working in projects that contain more than just a "main.cpp" file. Some projects may have hundreds or even thousands of implementation files and header files and we need to know how to tell CMake to find them and use them.
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>

                    <span class="highlight">FOLDER STRUCTURE</span><br>
                    There are usually two ways to structure our project in terms of header files and implementation files. the first method is to create an include and src folder and place every header file inside of the include folder and every implemenation file inisde of the src folder. while this is a valid way I perfer to create an include and src per each of my projects. this way I can resemble the modular feel of a project better by having only files associtaed with a project inisde of them and creating multiple sub folders based off each of the projecs names. Something similar to this example:
                </p>
                
                folder 
                        src
                        include
                        subproject
                                src
                                include
                                ...

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">OVERVIEW</span><br>
                    A library is a collection of precompiled code that you can use in your programs to avoid having to write common functionalities from scratch. Nobody writes 100% of the code for an app or a project themselves. It’s too much work. Instead, we link our code to
libraries of code written by others (or ourselves). Libraries that we create our selves are usually refered to as custom libraries or internal libraries. lbirarisa that are made by others are usually called third-party libarrysie or external libarries.
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                
                <p>
                    on top of the different libraries types they come in different flavours and formats. However, there are usually two types in the world of C and C++. Static and Shared. Let's take a quick peek at each of them:
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>

                <ul class="justified-list-ul">
                    <li><span class="highlight">STATIC</span><br>
                    These libraries are linked to your program at compile time. The code from the library is copied into the final executable, which increases the size of the executable but means the program doesn't need the library file at runtime. However, at the same time each process or program instance needs to load the library seperately resuling in massive resource usage if so. These libraries are more convinet to work with as they do not create external dependencies when deploying your project or executable. On Windows we use ".lib" extension (short for library) to represent static librarise and on Unix like systems (Linux/MacOS) we use ".a" extensions (short for archive).</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><span class="highlight">SHARED (DYNAMIC)</span><br>
                    These are linked at runtime, meaning the library code is not included in the executable. Instead, the executable loads the library dynamically when the program starts. This keeps the executable size smaller but requires the library to be present on the system where the program runs. The great thing is that the library code can be shared across multiple processes and programs acrosse the operating system resulting in saving resources and performance. the problem is that each library creates a potential dependcy point which if not fonud results in annoying runtime problems such as project or executable not runnig and not working. On Windows they are represented with ".dll" exetnsion (short for "Dynamic-Link Library") and On MacOS with ".dylib" extension (short for "Dynamic Library") and ".so" on Linux (short for "Shared Object").</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                
                
                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>
                
                
                <p>
                   <span class="highlight">Internal library creation</span><br>
                   When you set an include directory using target_include_directories() in CMake, you specify where the compiler should look for header files during preprocessing. The compiler then resolves #include directives using these path. This is the reason why you do not need to include the full relative path to the file and can just specify the file name itself. 
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                
                <p>
                   Header files contain declarations (and possibly inline definitions or templates), not complete, standalone units of code. They are included into source files via the #include directive, and the compiler processes them as part of the source files that include them. This means the compiler only sees and processes header files when compiling the corresponding .cpp files by just pasting them into the cpp file. 
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                
                <p>
                   Due to their nature, In CMake, header files usually don't need to be explicitly added to the target because they are not directly compiled. despite this you will sometimes see them being specified and added to CMake's target_sources() or add_executable()/add_library() commands which primarily deal with compilable files. some environments such as IDEs and text editors may use the list of files here to detect what files need to be shown in the project view. Other than that, this act has no significance and you will see many programmers add other types of files such as txt, image, and others like this as will which the compiler will simply ignore all other types of files that are not compilable.
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">IMPLEMENTATION FILES (*.CPP)</span><br>
                    Implementation files (*.cpp) contain the actual definintions for functions, classes, and other entities. These files are the main source that need to be compiled by the complier. To add these files we can either directly add them to the target commands such as add_executbale() and add_library() or we can use a seperate command of target_sources() which I actually perfer like this:
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <div class="spacer-topic"></div>
                
                
                
                
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">SCOPE VISIBILITY</span><br>
                    You may have noticed that commands such as target_sources(), target_include_directories() and many others yet to come have a PUBLIC, PRIVATE, INTERFACE argument. These arguments specify the visibilty of the files and resources of the current resources to any other modules or projects that may want to add our current sub-project to themselves and how much they will be able to see.
                </p>
                
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                
                <ul class="justified-list-ul">
                    <li><span class="highlight">PRIVATE</span><br>
                    This means that the files and resources are only visible to the current target and any project or enitity that decides to include the current target will not be able to see these files or interact with them.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><span class="highlight">PUBLIC</span><br>
                    This means that the files and resources are visible to the current target and any project or enitity that decides to include the current target will be able to see these files and interact with them.</li>
                    
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="highlight">INTERFACE</span><br>
                    This means that properties and dependencies of the current target are meant to be propagated to other targets that link against it or include it.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>
                
                <p>
                    PRIVATE is usually used for implementation files in target_sources() since no other module or logical unit must be aware of these files and their implementation. PUBLIC is usually used with header files and target_include_diretories() as other modules and logical units that intend on using our project and resources need to be aware of the symbols availble to them.INTERFACE is usually used only with header-only libraries and heavy templated libraries as they mostly do not have any object files.

                    One last thing that I want to mention is that there are 3 stages to creating and using libraries. First we need to instruct CMake to create the library from the source files that was provided to it. If the library is internal or made by us, then we will tell CMake. If the library is third-party or external, then the programmer either has the code or if they made the library, then this step is already completed. the second step is finding the library. in internal ones, CMake already knows it exists and where to find it since we instructed it to, in exetrnal ones CMake needs to be instructed with various methods on how to find it and bring it into the project tree structure. Last but not least we need to instruct CMake on how to add it to a target for using. all of this will be covered inidivdually for internal and external libraries.

                    <span class="highlight">Creation phase</span><br>
                    For STATIC lbiraries this is an easy process. Due to the nature of Static libraries and the fact that they will be incoporated into the final target without any additional dependencies, All we have to do to is tell cmake the source files and instruct it to create the library as static and we will be done with the creation phase. The following code is a small representation of this process:
                </p>


file(GLOB SOURCES "*.cpp" "*.h")
add_executable(my_app ${SOURCES})

                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    For dynamic libraries this is a different story.

                    <span class="highlight">Finding and using it</span><br>
                    When it comes to Static libraries they are already found and embedded into the final target. Therefore there is no need to do anything. For Sharde libraries however, this is a different story.

                    As you can see shared libraries are really tricky. this is also the reasno why most programmers tend to avoid them as much as possible. the hassel is just too great for the prize.

                <h2>Project architecture using sub-libraries</h2>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    In the previous section we saw how to have multiple folders with different parts and files. Howeever, the problem with such an approach is that while we ourselves can visually see and distinguish the different parts, to the compiler it just looks like there is still one massive logical unit or target (executable) that has a lot of files in different locations. so, while it may seem as if we seperated our project into different parts and cleaned it, we do not recieve any major benefints from the compiler side which means that if one of thees files are changed the whole logical unit or target needs to be recompiled again with all files. this can be very slow depending on the size of the project.
                </p>
                
                
                
                <p>
                    Another way to sub-divide a large project is to split it into sub-libraries where every subdirectory and its set of modules are considerede an independet library target. This works very well. But, isn’t it overkill? Besides, isn't the point of libariers to be reusable? Yes, creating libraries is unnecessary for code that isn’t shared, but dividing a project into libraries could have the following benefits:
                </p>

                For starters, linking a few static libraries is faster than linking the same code from
hundreds of individual object files. The reduced linking time alone could make this a no-brainer for very
large projects.


using sub-libraries is more flexible and provides clearer structure. Every sub-project is nicely
encapsulated, with clear boundaries between all the program’s various modules. 



on top of all of this, each target lbirary is conisdered an individual logical unit that won't need to be recompiled if some other part is changed. this can save a tremendous amount of time when compiling.



Example code:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24)
project(hello_world)

#Dependencies
add_subdirectory(libs/Greetings)

# Our Project
set(SOURCE_FILES

 Main.cpp)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCE_FILES})
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} Greetings)
libs/Greetings/CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24)
project(Greetings)

# Our Project
set(SOURCE_FILES

 src/Hello.cpp)

add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} STATIC ${SOURCE_FILES})
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC include)

                <h2>External libraries</h2>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    This is probably the part that makes programmers hate cmake and probably the reason why cmake is hated so much and has a bad reputation. Until now, things were not that bad, creating libraries seems very much intuitive, but that is because we were in charge of creating them and knew how we wanted to build them as in static or dynamic, and we also were able to find them and had control what to do in each scenario and to copy shared libraries to the executable locations if need be. But, what if we are not the ones creating the libraries and dont know and have no contorl about the details of their achitecture?

I am talking about external libraries. chances are if you are developing in C++ that you would use exetranla or also named third-party libraies extensively. and for good reason, there is a lot of things to worry about and we need some kind of interface or API to handle things for us such as talking to the Operating System and using the underliying capabilties. You may have heard about libarries that others have created such as fmt, lnohman, Boost, and many others and always wanted to use them.

So, why is this part so hated? it is because of the enurmouse different ways to add and incluide exetrnal library dependecies. We have find_package(), fetchcontentt(), and adding diretly to source. And each have their problmes. On top of this we need to worry about static and dynamic concepts, and what happens after.

                <h2>Common errors</h2>


                <div class="spacer-paragraph"></div>


                <p>
                    As we know the compiler takes our source files and converts them into object files (.o for linux and macos and .obj for windows). The linker will attempt to bring togeter all of the generated object files and combine them into a meaningful target such as an executable or even another big unified library. However, most of the time our code contains symbols that are not entirely defined, either because we did not define them in the implementation file or we included a header file that only contains symbols. The problem is that when the complire transforms each of our implementation files into an object file there will be holes and missing parts (references) where we attempted to use the symbolic code but could not find the actual definintion at that moment of time. So, what ends up happening is that when the linker tries to bring togeter all of these files it must also make sure that anything that is missing or is half reference and has missing parts must be fully found and taken care of before being able to make the final big thing. it accomplishes this by looking at the symbol such as "Foo" funciton and then trying its best to find the actual defininiot part by looking at every other object file it knows off. If it is succesful everything goes well. But, if it cannot find it it will throw a linker error which are those annoynig errors everyone is afaird of that usually says "Was not able to find symbol or edifininot.." or something in those lines. In these cases this means that something went wrong and we were not able to fully provide a good way for the linker to find our library. when such things happen, it uaslly means the part of our code that include the library is wrong. and honestly except for having experience there is no way to fully say what the problem is. but, here are some common ways that I have found most likely is the problem:



you forgot to use target_include_library().
