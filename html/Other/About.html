                    Hi there! I’m <span class="specialText">Saviz Mohammadi</span>, also known in the tech world as <span class="specialText">UFO Coder</span>. I’m currently a computer science student at <span class="specialText">Simon Fraser University (SFU)</span>, where I’m diving deep into the fascinating world of technology. My focus areas include <span class="specialText">C/C++</span>, <span class="specialText">Qt/QML</span>, and <span class="specialText">CMake</span>, and I’m always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my knowledge. My journey in coding has been a thrilling one, marked by hands-on experience with a variety of technologies.
                </p>


                <div class="spacerText"></div>


                <p>
                    I thrive on solving complex problems and turning ideas into functional, efficient solutions. Whether I’m working on a new project or experimenting with different tech, my passion for coding drives me to continuously learn and innovate. Thanks for stopping by my corner of the web. I’m excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and explore new opportunities in the ever-evolving tech landscape! Feel free to explore some of my projects and courses listed below.

                <h2>Projects</h2>

                <p>
                    As a software developer, I dedicate much of my time to creating projects and templates using C/C++ and Qt/QML technologies. Feel free to explore some of my work below and see if anything catches your interest. Please feel free to reach out with any suggestions or advice on my projects. I welcome your feedback on areas that might need improvement, as well as any new ideas you might have.

                <h2>UFO_CMake</h2>

                <p>
                    Setting up a C++ development environment can be quite challenging due to the numerous toolchains, IDEs, and platforms, each with its own unique requirements. Managing these, along with integrating useful tools and libraries for your project, can become a real hassle. To address this, I created the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Saviz-Mohammadi/UFO_CMake" target="_blank">UFO_CMake</a> project. This project uses <span class="specialText">CMake</span> under the hood and is designed to provide a clear, user-friendly structure and environment for creating C++ projects with all the essential components you might need. If you find the project useful, please consider giving it a star—it really helps!
                </p>


                <div class="spacerText"></div>


                <h2>UFO_QML</h2>

                <p>
                    The Qt company is undoubtedly a leader in delivering top-notch software and tools for C++ development. Their latest technology, QtQuick, along with the QML language, is certainly worth considering. However, many programmers struggle with setting up a clean and efficient environment using the <span class="specialText">Qt Creator IDE</span>. To address this challenge, I created the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Saviz-Mohammadi/UFO_QML" target="_blank">UFO_QML</a> project. This project utilizes <span class="specialText">CMake</span> to provide a clear and user-friendly structure for developing C++/QML projects, complete with all the essential components you might need. If you find the project useful, please consider giving it a star—it really helps!

                <h2>Git for beginners</h2>

                <p>
                    In today’s industry, proficiency with Git is essential. Whether you need to recover from mistakes or collaborate with others on codebases, Git is a crucial tool to master. I’ve created a course titled <a class="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-guide-for-beginners/" target="_blank">"Git and GitHub - The step by step guide for beginners"</a> to help programmers learn the basics and get started with Git. The course is available on Udemy. If you find it helpful, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could share it with your friends and colleagues and leave a rating.
